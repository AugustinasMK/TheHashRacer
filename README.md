# TheHashRacer
## Introduction
Hi and welcome to the Race. This is a benchmark designed for VU MIF ISI students to race their hash generators in speed and reliability.
This program expects you to have created a C++ program that respects the requirements of [1-oji užduotis: Hash generatorius](https://github.com/blockchain-group/Blockchain-technologijos/blob/master/pratybos/1uzduotis-Hashavimas.md). Without further ado, LET'S GET RACING!
